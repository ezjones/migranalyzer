<h1>Migraines can be triggered by weather changes</h1>

<p>But there is not much info about how, why or when they happen. Some people believe it's the Barometric Pressure that causes headaches, others think it all a myth. I have tried all kinds of medicines and alternative medicine solutions but there is nothing that really works. There is also "Migraine Predictors" out there but I found that they don't work at all.</p>

  <p>This personal project is in its initial stages. Now I am capturing the weather and my "Headache amount" and trying to compare the two. I have plans to introduce more variables to compare.
</p>


  <h1>UPDATE (10/6/2015):</h1>
<p>
  I have been capturing data for the past several months. <b>Weather changes</b> are definately related to migraines. But after a lot of tests I came to the conclusion that they <b>are not the cause!.</b> 
</p>
<p>
I tried to find the problem the same way you would do <b>debugging.</b> You narrow the problem down to its most basic components and build from there.  What I did was to cut all shit food and started eating the most simple things like fruits and vegetables. Then I waited for a weather change to happen. To my surprise, the weather changed and I <b>wasn't dying in pain.</b>
</p>

<h1>So what was causing my migraines?</h1>
<b>Mucus.</b> Mucus created inside the body because of eating shit. What I noticed is that when temperature and humidity changed, the <b>mucus inside my body inflated.</b> And that's why I was getting terrible headaches!

<p>
  So now no more blaming the weather for my headaches. I blame myself for the shit I eat! What kind of shit? <b>Shit food that creates mucus.</b> People with migraines know that food can be a trigger. In my case I know it's food that creates mucus. I thought I was eating healthy and exercising but I was still eating things that create tons of mucus in the body.</p>
<p>
  Of course it's pretty boring to eat only fruits and spinach every day but you can do like this. Eat healthier stuff in general and if you eat a bit of shit then do something to clean the body right away. Eat things that destroy mucus like radishes.</p>


  <h1>Tricks I do every day</h1>
  - Use a <b>neti pot.</b> <br>
  - <b>Morning tea.</b> Made of warm water, turmeric, lemon and ginger.<br>
  - Use <b>more turmeric</b> everywhere. <br>Turmeric is an Anti-inflammatory. Instead of taking an advil I make a tea with a lot of turmeric.<br>
  - <b>Radishes.</b> These are like the most anti-mucus thing you can eat.<br>
  - <b>TNT juice bomb.</b> Green juice with a tbsp of chia seeds, flax seed and hemp. <br>

  <h1>Do the test yourself:</h1>
  <p>The next time you have a migraine <b>check if your nostrils are clear or not</b>. Do you feel something heavy inside your forehead? If you do, <b>time to get rid of that mucus baby!</b></p>

<h1>Update!</h1>
  <p>After some extra months of testing and research I think I found the root of the problem. Low digestive power.

Yes, weather changes giving me headaches by inflating and deflating the mucus in the head. Decreasing the mucus decreased the problem but what was causing the mmucus in the first place? It was a low digestive power. If you have this problem, it takes a really long time to digest food, you feel bloated regularly, you go to sleep and wake up still digesting stuff. Even when not eating big quantities of food. If you overeat you are dead, that's for sure. And the problem is that all this depends on YOUR body and YOUR digestive power so everybody has a different experience.

I went to the doctor a while ago and after I told him my problem he said: it looks like you are not trying the hard stuff.

By that he meant hard drugs. Prescription drugs way stronger than the simple advils I was taking at the time. The thing is that if you have low digestive power and take any of this medicines, your digestive power will get EVEN WORSE! Taking any of this medicines that the doctor was recommending would have only increased the mucus in the body making my headaches INCREASE! Of course I am not taking any Advils now and of course I will not try any of the hard stuff. No thanks Doctor.

One thing that I am trying now is something called Hinga Shtak. They are ayurvedic herbs and spices in the form of pills that seem to increase the digestive power. Search for them in Amazon. They smell like india spices. I als feel they give me a stomach shield. It takes time to feel the effect because this kind of medicines are not nuclear like wester medicines. I have been trying for 6 months and the headaches are now in the 0 to 3 range. Mostly 0.

So yeah, listening to the doctor would have made things worse. If you have a similar problem I suggest that you try to find the solution yourself and get a bit scientific about it. Measure 5 times a day how you feel and track absolutely everthing. Rething everything you are doing, what you are eating, what soap you are using, everything.

Nobody is going to do it for you.

<h1>ARCHIVE</h1>
  <h1>How the analysis worked:</h1>
  <p>I have a python script running on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> on a Linux VM. From there I grab the Weather Forecast and send it to Google SpreadSheets. There I create and publish these charts. The Headache Amount is the only data entered manually by me. I try to enter it manually several times a day. Eventually I will create the charts in python too and skip Gdocs but for now it works.</p>

<h1>Data for June 2015:</h1>
<p> Below you can see the June charts. Humidity and Headache amount look quite similar. I will have to compare them more closely in the future.</p>

<h1>This is all data since I started capturing</h1>
<p>There is small gap in the weather data when the script stopped working for a few days.</p>

<p>If you have migraines and are interested in capturing your headache data let me know. If more people gather data we will be able to find a pattern faster. Thanks</p>
