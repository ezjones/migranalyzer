# migranalyzer
Migraines analyzer.

I started this project to find out what causes my migraines. I have tried at least 50 apps and none really helped me to understand the problem.

I am pretty sure my migraines are cause by weather changes but it's hard to predict. On top of that none of the Migraine predictors out there seem to work.

The python script captures the weather for a location and then sends the data to Google Spreadsheets. I have a Google Form where I enter my "Headache amount" that adds data to that same spreadsheet.

I exported the data for everybody to see and analyze. Ideally we would have a site or app with user authentication and location awareness but for now this works.

I have several *arduinos* and sensors that we can use to capture data. The next step will be to capture my "Room Weather" to see if that has any relationship. I think capturing the room is important because the AC in the summer or heating in the winter affect you quite differently.

Also, I have been wearing a *fitbit* with heart rate monitor for a month or so. They have an API so we will be able to compare this data too.

That' all. 
I just made my headache open source!
